These cards were used at E3 in 2002 to demonstrate the new e-Reader.

They were english translation versions of the Japanese cards and thus contain many formatting differences.

The cards were not permitted to leave E3 and thus very few are available.

Please see the [Pichu Blog](https://pichu.blog/english-expedition-base-set) for an extensive writeup.

PSA labels will include "No Holo" for this variant.

For context, within the Team Rocket expansion all of the rare Pokemon cards included a holofoil and non-holofoil version of the card.
These would be two separate cards in the set, and in the case of Dark Dragonite:
- Holofoil version: card #5 out of 82
- Non-holo version: card #22 out of 82

However a print eror occured early on both prints that had card 5/82 but without holofoil.

The [Mt. Moon Error guide](https://mt-moon.proboards.com/thread/20744/masters-guide-pokemon-corrected-errors) states:

> Mistakenly printed within an uncommons card sheet print run for Team Rocket. Received in Team Rocket (peg hanger) packs, and reportedly short seal as well.
> Received in Team Rocket (peg hanger) packs, and reportedly short seal as well.
> Produced in both 1st edition and unlimited print. The first edition print is moderately more rare.

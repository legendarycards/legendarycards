category: uncommon

Within the Team Rocket expansion all of the rare Pokemon cards included a holofoil and non-holo version of the card.
These would be two separate cards in the set, and in the case of Dark Dragonite:
- Holofoil version: card #5 out of 82
- Non-holo version: card #22 out of 82

However a pre-print eror occured early on both prints that had card 5/82 but without holofoil.

PSA labels will include "No Holo" for this variant.

title: Fossil Unlimited set Zapdos Corrected Evolution Box
description: The holofoil is corrected to not show the evolution box outline.
category: rare
set: fossil-unlimited
---

The Fossil Unlimited set Zapdos commonly has an error where the evolution box outline does not contain holofoil.

Later in the print runs this was corrected and the evolution box placeholder was removed.

The corrected version of this card is rare.

Note that the "Unlimited" print run has two variations, and they can be identified by inspecting the copyright.
The first run uses a "1999" copyright and the second uses "1999-2000". The rare version of this card is the "1999" copyright variant.
The "1999-2000" variant will have a Cosmos holofoil pattern.

There is another rare variant of Fossil Zapdos that includes the "1999" copyright, corrected evolution box, and Cosmos holo.

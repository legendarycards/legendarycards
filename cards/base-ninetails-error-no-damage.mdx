title: Base set Ninetails Missing Damage Error
description: This is a typeset pre-print error where the "80" damage is missing from the Fire Blast attack.
category: legendary
set: base-shadowless

The normal card is a Base set Shadowless Ninetails, and the error verion is missing the pre-print "80" text.

There it at least [one claimed PSA grading](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/demirq/i_present_you_the_shadowless_ninetales_no_damage/) (serial 24281314, and 27017323) of this error.
The PSA title does not distinguish the error version of the card compared to the normal shadowless version.
This matches expectations for other error variants and the important part is that PSA authenticates the card manufacturing.

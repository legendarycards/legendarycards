The "Ivy" Pikachu and Jigglypuff Black Star promo cards were released before their official print with "grey star" set icons.
These appeared as cards included in the Japanese print magazine called CoroCoro.

The cards have a unique glossy finish unlike the official prints.

The [PSA Facts](https://www.psacard.com/cardfacts/non-sports-cards/1999-nintendo-pokemon-japanese-corocoro-comics-promo/ivy-pikachu-glossy-grey-star/696122) for Pikachu distinguish this variant as "1999 P.M. Japanese Promo" and "Glossy CoroCoro Comics - Grey Star".

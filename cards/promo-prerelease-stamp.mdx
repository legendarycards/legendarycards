Each of these cards was distributed as part of the Pokemon League tournaments related to the upcoming expansion release.

Note that there are two versions of the Areodactyl "PRERELEASE" card. One with a Brown stamp, and one with a Gold stamp distributed in the UK, which is more rare.

For the prerelease Clefable there is some additional lore:

> It was first rumored that four versions of this Prerelease promotional card exist
> (with the stamp having one of four different color variations: green, red, gold, and blue),
> though this has since been confirmed to be false. Only the green stamped variant was publicly released.

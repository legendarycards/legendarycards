The "4th print" of the Base set is the same as the Unlimited set except that the copyright year changed from "1999" to "1999-2000".

The non-holographic cards in this print were widely distributed from several print shops.
This print uses the normal Starlight holographic pattern.

The holographic cards were only printed in the United Kingdom, making these variants hard to find.
From [this Mt. Moon discussion](https://mt-moon.proboards.com/thread/13363/base-2000-guide-last-print): 

> The U.K. print grows to become the most recognizable print of this subset due to be the only one confirmed to yield Holographic Cards with the 1999-2000 copyright change.
> The denomination U.K. Print Run is hence born.
> However, some booster packs made in U.K. will still yield normal 1999 Unlimited Holos.

Both of these cards are non-holo versions of the english Black Star promos.

The Mewoth card is harder to find compared to Eevee, and even more difficult to find in Mint/Gem condition due to the distribution packaging.

The PSA labels will use "2000 Pokemon Promo" and "JR. Stamp Rally" to identify the variants, though it is common for PSA to make mistakes with these cards.
These rare variants are non-holo and PSA has graded many holo versions and incorrectly included this label.

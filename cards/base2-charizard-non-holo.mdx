title: Base set 2 Non-holo Charizard Printing Error
description: The Base set 2 Charizard Holographic card is printed without the holofoil.
category: mythical
set: base2
---

The Base set 2 edition holographic cards do not have alternative prints such as non-holo or reverse-holo.

This non-holo Charizard is likely the result of a printing error or early test-print.

CGCCards has authenticated this card and mentions:

> A thorough analysis revealed that this card was meant to be holographic but, as a result of a production error at WOTC, it is missing the holographic foil layer.

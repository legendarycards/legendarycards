The normal and common Base set Unlimited Ninetales cards have a blue flame in the holographic artwork. This variant card is likely from an early Unlimited print run.

CGC Cards will [grade thie variant](https://www.cgccards.com/news/article/8861/pokemon-ninetales-variant/) with a "Blake Flame" label. They mention:

> Due to their similarity with the art on the 1st Edition and Shadowless Ninetales cards, which were of course printed first, it is likely that these Ninetales with the “Black Flames” are from an early Unlimited print run.

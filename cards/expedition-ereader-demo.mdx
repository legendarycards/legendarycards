This card is glossy and has a hole punch through the center of it.

These cards were used in retail stores to test the new e-Reader.

Two versions of these cards exist (while only one version is displayed here):
- The first variant type includes both a front and back glossy finish.
- The second variant type includes only a front gloss finish, with a matte back.

CGC will grade the variant with the label "Demo", "Hole Punched", and "Matte Back" or "Glossy Back". As of 2022, PSA does not support grading the hole-punched cards.

Please see both the [Pichu Blog](https://pichu.blog/english-expedition-base-set) and this [Mt. Moon discussion](https://mt-moon.proboards.com/thread/3098/any-information-on-cards) for more information.

Note that these hole-punched cards are different from the E3 test print cards.

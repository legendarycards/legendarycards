title: Base set Beedrill "D.efending" Error
description: Poison Sting's attack text includes a period in the middle of the word "Defending".
category: epic
set: base-unlimited
---

This error was present in early print runs of unlimited Base set.
[Some analysis](https://zandergb.tumblr.com/post/183709235827/edit-knowledge-of-this-error-is-a-bit-more) conclues there are specific Overgrowth Deck boxes that may contain the error.

Additionally, they write:

> Since there is an actual space along with the dot between the D and e in Defending, this is not a printing process error.
This is a typesetting error, and one that seemingly got noticed and corrected very quickly.

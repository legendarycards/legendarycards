These cards are likely to have been printed in filler or gap positions on large print sheets and intended to be removed/discards.

PSA does not grade these variants.

The story from this [Mt. Moon discussion](https://mt-moon.proboards.com/thread/5306/fpo-position-cards-official-guide) includes:

> The packs had the same artwork as the LEGENDARY Collection packs, as this was the most recent set and Expedition was not out yet, but they were never distributed outside of the design team.
> As these test packs were being destroyed, a former WOTC employee saved them from the shredder and kept them in his personal collection.
> He opened a few of the packs and left the rest sealed.
> They sat in storage for over a decade until he decided to sell off some of the extra stuff he had lying around.
> When this happened, a whole new collectible was introduced into the Pokemon community.
> The cards inside are much different from the cards that were eventually released within the Expedition Base Set expansion.
